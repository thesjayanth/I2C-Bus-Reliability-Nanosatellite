🔍 Abstract

Despite being widely used in nanosatellite operations, the I²C bus has dependability issues that can lead to catastrophic failures.
This study conducts a detailed fault analysis of the I²C protocol within CubeSat systems, exploring hardware/software vulnerabilities and proposing checksum-based mitigation methods (Simple Sum, XOR, and CRC).
Experimental and Verilog-based simulations confirm improved data integrity and communication reliability for space-grade embedded systems.
